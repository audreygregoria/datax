The file data_prototype2.csv is the dataset we manually collected for the number of followers/members for the different platforms available. 

The file DataX_Final_Project_Code.ipnyb is the model that we used to determine the price in Ethereum of an NFT based on the number of social media followers. 

The NFT_Tweets_sentiment_analysis.ipnyb file uses twitter API to provide sentiment analysis for the NFT name provided by the artist. 

The dataX_project_final_model_used.ipynb file uses the model with the best accuracy that we achieved to predict the floor price of the NFT.
